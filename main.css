<!-- The whole css file is for the black background with the text font to be courier new as it is the closest font to a hacker terminal and then the color scheme i actually google for so i knew the exact color needed which was #0f8. The positioning and display is meant so that the text would not start so far left or too far right because of how hacker terminals start from the left and never the dead center -->
